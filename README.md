# catch
A 'released' version of the github project www.github.com/philsquared/Catch.  Catch is a header based C++ Unit test framework

Unittests are an integral part of Outcast (see www.integerfox.com/outcast) and the Catch framework is used in many of the Outcast packages.  Why a 'copy'?  I need an Outcast'ized package of the Catch source code - so this repository is for that purpose (the Outcast tools are currently not sophisticated enough to pull directly from phisquared/Catch github project).  If you are interested in Catch, please proceed to its project www.github.com/philsquared/Catch
